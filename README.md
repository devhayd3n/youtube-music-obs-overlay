   ```
3. ▶️ Run the application:

## 🎮 Usage

1. 🚀 Launch the application - it will open YouTube Music in an Electron window
2. 🌐 The overlay server will start automatically on `http://localhost:3000`
3. 📹 In OBS, add a Browser Source with the URL: `http://localhost:3000`

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **💻 Electron App**: Loads YouTube Music and extracts song data using DOM polling
- **🌐 Express Server**: Serves the overlay HTML and provides a JSON API endpoint
- **🔄 Real-time Updates**: Song information is polled every 2 seconds and served via `/now-playing` endpoint
- **🌋 Volcanic Theme**: CSS animations create glowing borders and falling fire particle effects

## 🔌 API

The application exposes a JSON API at `http://localhost:3000/now-playing` that returns:

```json
{
  "title": "Song Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "albumArt": "https://album-art-url.jpg"
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

The overlay styling can be customized by editing `/public/index.html`. The volcanic theme includes:

- 🔴 Glowing red borders with pulsing animation
- 🔥 Fire particle effects that fall inside the overlay
- 🚀 Custom "Orbitron" font for a futuristic look
- 🌋 Semi-transparent volcanic color scheme
